    <h2>After Apple-Picking</h2>
    <p>My long two-pointed ladder's sticking through a tree<br>
        Toward heaven still,<br>
        And there's a barrel that I didn't fill<br>
        Beside it, and there may be two or three<br>
        Apples I didn't pick upon some bough.<br>
        But I am done with apple-picking now.<br>
        Essence of winter sleep is on the night,<br>
        The scent of apples: I am drowsing <br>
        I cannot rub the strangeness from my sight<br>
        I got from looking through a pane of glass<br>
        I skimmed this morning from the drinking trough<br>
        And held against the world of hoary grass.<br>
        It melted, and I let it fall and break.<br>
        But I was well<br>
        Upon my way to sleep before it fell,<br>
        And I could tell<br>
        What form my dreaming was about to take.<br>
        Magnified apples appear and disappear,<br>
        Stem end and blossom end,<br>
        And every fleck of russet showing clear.<br>
        My instep arch not only keeps the ache,<br>
        It keeps the pressure of a ladder-round.<br>
        I feel the ladder sway as the boughs bend.<br>
        And I keep hearing from the cellar bin<br>
        The rumbling sound<br>
        Of load on load of apples coming in.<br>
        For I have had too much<br>
        Of apple-picking: I am overtired<br>
        Of the great harvest I myself desired.<br>
        There were ten thousand thousand fruit to touch,<br>
        Cherish in hand, lift down, and not let fall.<br>
        For all<br>
        That struck the earth,<br>
        No matter if not bruised or spiked with stubble,<br>
        Went surely to the cider-apple heap<br>
        As of no worth.<br>
        One can see what will trouble<br>
        This sleep of mine, whatever sleep it is.<br>
        Were he not gone,<br>
        The woodchuck could say whether it's like his<br>
        Long sleep, as I describe its coming on,<br>
        Or just some human sleep.<br>
        </p>
