    <h2>Addressed to Haydon</h2>
    <p>Highmindedness, a jealousy for good,<br>
        A loving-kindness for the great man’s fame,<br>
        Dwells here and there with people of no name,<br>
        In noisome alley, and in pathless wood:<br>
        And where we think the truth least understood,<br>
        Oft may be found a “singleness of aim,”<br>
        That ought to frighten into hooded shame<br>
        A money mong’ling, pitiable brood.<br>
        How glorious this affection for the cause<br>
        Of stedfast genius, toiling gallantly!<br>
        What when a stout unbending champion awes<br>
        Envy, and Malice to their native sty?<br>
        Unnumber’d souls breathe out a still applause,<br>
        Proud to behold him in his country’s eye.</p>
