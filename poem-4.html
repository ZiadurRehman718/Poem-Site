    <h2>Alone</h2>
    <p>From childhood's hour I have not been<br>
        As others were; I have not seen<br>
        As others saw; I could not bring<br>
        My passions from a common spring.<br>
        From the same source I have not taken<br>
        My sorrow; I could not awaken<br>
        My heart to joy at the same tone;<br>
        And all I loved, I loved alone.<br>
        Then- in my childhood, in the dawn<br>
        Of a most stormy life- was drawn<br>
        From every depth of good and ill<br>
        The mystery which binds me still:<br>
        From the torrent, or the fountain,<br>
        From the red cliff of the mountain,<br>
        From the sun that round me rolled<br>
        In its autumn tint of gold,<br>
        From the lightning in the sky<br>
        As it passed me flying by,<br>
        From the thunder and the storm,<br>
        And the cloud that took the form<br>
        (When the rest of Heaven was blue)<br>
        Of a demon in my view.</p>
