    <h2>A Fairy Song </h2>
    <p>Over hill, over dale,<br>
        Thorough bush, thorough brier,<br>
        Over park, over pale,<br>
        Thorough flood, thorough fire!<br>        
        I do wander everywhere,<br>
        Swifter than the moon's sphere;<br>
        And I serve the Fairy Queen,<br>
        To dew her orbs upon the green;<br>
        The cowslips tall her pensioners be;<br>
        In their gold coats spots you see;<br>
        Those be rubies, fairy favours;<br>
        In those freckles live their savours;<br>
        I must go seek some dewdrops here,<br>
        And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.</p>
